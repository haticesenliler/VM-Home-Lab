Downloaded VirtualBox in order to create my own virtual machines.
Installed a Windows 10 ISO file and attached it to the VM as a guest operating system.
Installed Kali Linux in VirtualBox.
Both VMs are managed within the VirtualBox virtual machine manager.
Changed the network settings of both virtual machines to Internal Network so they could communicate with each othe without internet access. 
Manually assigned IP addresses to each VM in order to configure networking properly.
Verified communication between the hosts using ping.
